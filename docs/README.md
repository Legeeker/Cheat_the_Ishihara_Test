# Cheat_the_Ishihara_Test
The Ishihara test is designed to diagnose variations of color blindness or deficiencies.

The goal of this project is to develop a program using computer vision techniques to cheat the Ishihara test. my program  is capable of analyzing various Ishihara plates and detecting their features.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a tool that leverages computer vision algorithms to interpret and manipulate Ishihara test plates, allowing users to bypass the traditional color vision assessment.

## Features

- Analyze Ishihara test plates.
- Detect and manipulate features in the plates.
- Provide insights into variations of color blindness.
## Structure du Projet

The project is organized as follows:

- **`src/`**: This directory contains the application's source code.
  - **`main.py`**: Entry point of the application.
  - **`final_result/`**: Final result on an image.

- **`data/`**: This directory contains the necessary data for tests and examples.
  - **`ishihara_plates/`**: Images of Ishihara plates for tests.
  - **`ishihara_tests/`**: This directory contains Ishihara test codes.

- **`docs/`**: Project documentation.
  - **`README.md`**: Main documentation.
