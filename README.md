# Cheat_the_Ishihara_Test
The Ishihara test is designed to diagnose variations of color blindness or deficiencies.

The goal of this project is to develop a program using computer vision techniques to cheat the Ishihara test. my program  is capable of analyzing various Ishihara plates and detecting their features.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a tool that leverages computer vision algorithms to interpret and manipulate Ishihara test plates, allowing users to bypass the traditional color vision assessment.

## Features

- Analyze Ishihara test plates.
- Detect and manipulate features in the plates.
- Provide insights into variations of color blindness.
